# Development notes

Internal-facing notes on architecture, build mechanics, and
contributor workflows for `skar_py`.

## Architecture

A thin Cython binding around a small C-ABI shim that calls into the
upstream `skar_zig` package. The Python side accepts points as
`(lat, lng)` (degrees by default) or unit `(x, y, z)` vectors,
normalizes them to a contiguous `(N, 3)` float64 buffer with NumPy,
and hands that buffer to the Cython extension via a typed memoryview
(`double[:, ::1]`) — no copy. `[3]f64` on the Zig side is exactly that
row layout, so the shim reinterprets the pointer with no per-element
conversion.

The C-ABI shim (`src/zig/c_api.zig`) and `src/zig/build.zig` both live
here, not in the upstream `skar_zig` package. The split is
intentional:

- **`skar_zig` (upstream)**: pure Zig solver library. Exports a
  `Module` for other Zig code; no C ABI, no shared library.
- **`skar_py` (this repo)**: depends on `skar_zig` via
  `build.zig.zon`, wraps it in a tiny C ABI (`skar_solve`), builds a
  static archive, and links it directly into the Cython extension
  `_cy.<EXT>`.

libskar is a **static** archive (not a shared library) so it gets
pulled into `_cy.so` / `_cy.pyd` at link time. That sidesteps both the
Windows MSVC CRT mismatch and the macOS dylib `__dso_handle`
regression that shipping a Zig *dynamic* library triggers — the same
rationale as the sibling `sparea_py` bindings.

### What the shim exposes (minimal surface)

`skar.solve` returns a tagged `Outcome` union (`converged` /
`infeasible` / `did_not_converge`), not a single scalar. The shim
marshals the **headline result** into C out-params:

| out-param      | converged | did_not_converge | infeasible |
| -------------- | :-------: | :--------------: | :--------: |
| `status`       |     ✓     |        ✓         |     ✓      |
| `aspect_ratio` |     ✓     |   ✓ (uncertif.)  |     —      |
| `axis` (3)     |     ✓     |        ✓         |     —      |
| `sigma` (3)    |     ✓     |        ✓         |     —      |
| `gap`          |     ✓     |   ✓ (uncertif.)  |     —      |
| `outer_iters`  |     ✓     |        ✓         |     —      |
| `residual`     |     —     |        —         |     ✓      |

Fields not meaningful for a variant are left as NaN; the Python
wrapper maps them to `None` on the `Result` dataclass.

The variable-length active-set **certificate** (`cert.indices` /
`cert.lambdas`) is deliberately **not** surfaced — the shim frees it
via `outcome.deinit()` before returning. Exposing it would mean a
caller-owned-buffer protocol across the C boundary; defer that until a
consumer needs it. `checkFeasibility` is likewise not yet wired up.

The shim's `c_int` return value is the errors-vs-outcome split from
`skar_zig/src/api.zig`: `0` = "ran, see `status`"; non-zero = "could
not run" (insufficient points, invalid tolerance, coplanar input, OOM,
or an internal PSD/duality violation). `_cy.pyx` maps each non-zero
code to the matching Python exception.

```

The wheel ships a single `_cy.<EXT>` (the Cython extension with
libskar statically linked in); no separate dylib.

## Building and testing locally

```sh
just reinstall  # uv cache clean skar + uv sync --reinstall-package skar
just test       # reinstall + uv run pytest
just wheel      # uv build  (see the dependency-pin caveat below)
```

`uv sync` invokes meson-python, which runs Zig (via `python -m ziglang
build`, since `ziglang` is in `[build-system].requires`), then
cythonizes `src/cython/_cy.pyx` and links the result against the Zig
static archive. No host-level Zig or Cython install is needed — both
come from PyPI as build deps. Local dev uses non-editable installs
(`UV_NO_EDITABLE=1` at the top of the justfile) so each edit
force-reinstalls; `just test` chains through `just reinstall` so stale
artifacts don't survive a test run.

## The skar_zig dependency: local path vs. release pin

`src/zig/build.zig.zon` pins the upstream `skar` package. There are
two modes, and they behave differently for in-place builds vs.
sdist/wheel builds:

```zig
// Local development — resolve from the sibling checkout on disk.
.skar = .{ .path = "../../../skar_zig" },
```

- **In-place builds** (`just test`, `uv sync`) build from the source
  tree, so the relative `.path` resolves and everything works **with
  no network and without `skar_zig` on GitHub**. This is the loop for
  developing both sides together.
- **sdist / wheel builds** (`uv build`, `just wheel`, CI) build from
  an *isolated* sdist copy in a temp dir, where `../../../skar_zig` no
  longer exists. These require a URL+hash pin instead.

To switch to a release pin (needed before building wheels / publishing
/ running the `wheels` CI workflow):

```sh
cd src/zig && zig fetch --save=skar \
  https://github.com/ajfriend/skar_zig/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
```

That rewrites the `dependencies.skar` entry from `.path` to `.url` +
`.hash`. Re-run `just test` to confirm the pinned version still works.
(This is also how you bump to a newer `skar_zig` later — re-run
`zig fetch --save` against the new tag.)

## Continuous integration

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — runs `just ci-test` across
  {Linux, macOS, Windows} × {3.11–3.14}.
- `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` — builds the sdist + the full
  cibuildwheel matrix, and on a published GitHub release publishes to
  PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing.

Both build from an isolated sdist, so **CI only works once
`build.zig.zon` uses a URL+hash pin** (see the section above) — i.e.
after `skar_zig` is pushed and tagged on GitHub. With the local
`.path` pin, the in-place `test` workflow's `uv sync` step still works,
but the `wheels` workflow's sdist build does not.

## Cutting a release

Once the `pypi` Trusted-Publisher OIDC environment is configured on the
GitHub repo (no API tokens involved):

1. **Pin a released `skar_zig`** (see above) and commit it.
2. **Bump the version** in `pyproject.toml` (`project.version`). Commit
   + push to `main`. Wait for `test` and `wheels` to go green.
3. **Create a tag + release** on GitHub: Draft a new release → choose
   tag `vX.Y.Z` ("Create new tag on publish") → target `main` →
   Generate release notes → Publish.
4. **Watch the publish.** The release event triggers the `wheels`
   workflow; its `to-pypi` job downloads every artifact and pushes to
   PyPI via OIDC. If the `pypi` environment requires reviewers, approve
   the deployment.
5. **Verify** with `pip install skar==X.Y.Z` in a fresh venv.

PyPI versions and tags are immutable — if an upload fails mid-publish,
bump to `X.Y.Z+1` rather than reusing the number.
